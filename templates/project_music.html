  <h2>My Music – JoberSynth.exe</h2>
  <p>
    JoberSynth.exe is my music project: emotional, atmospheric tracks that
    blend electronic textures, trip-hop and downtempo vibes. The idea is to
    create soundtracks for my own universe (Sol, Nova City, NovaReels) and use
    music as a core part of the experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Style & influences</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Downtempo, trip-hop, ambient electronic.</li>
    <li>Cinematic, emotional and spacey textures.</li>
    <li>Designed to work as background for visuals, reels and storytelling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools & workflow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DAW:</strong> FL Studio</li>
    <li><strong>Instruments:</strong> MIDI keyboard / controller</li>
    <li><strong>Sound design:</strong> VST synths, pads, textured drums</li>
    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Use tracks inside NovaReels and Sol projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How it connects to my other projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Music for AI reels generated with NovaReels.</li>
    <li>Soundtracks for scenes and lore involving Sol and Nova City.</li>
    <li>Background music for future videos, demos and portfolio content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Status</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Ongoing.</strong> I’m composing new tracks, cleaning old ideas and
    planning how to publish them (reels, YouTube, streaming platforms) as part
    of my broader creative ecosystem.
